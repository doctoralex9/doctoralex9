# 👋 Hi — I’m Alexandros Melas

Welcome to my GitHub. I’m a software developer with a background in Python and mathematics and a practical focus on building small, useful apps that solve real problems. I like keeping things simple, reliable, and easy to understand.

## 💡 What I build

* **Web apps & APIs:** RESTful backends and simple web tools built with Flask and Django. I design APIs that connect data analysis code to user-facing interfaces.
* **Modern web frontends:** Projects using **Next.js** for fast, user-friendly interfaces and server-rendered pages.
* **Databases & hosting:** Work with **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and hosted services like **Supabase** to store and sync data across apps.
* **AI & integrations:** I’ve integrated services such as the **OpenAI API** and **Claude** (used in my MCP project), plus other third-party APIs — adding useful features like content generation, chat helpers, or live data feeds.
* **Data work:** Data cleaning, exploration, and plotting using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** to turn messy data into clear insights.
* **Frontend basics:** Clean and accessible UI with HTML and CSS to make tools easy to use.

## 🧠 How I work

I learn by building: every project is an opportunity to practice a new tool or pattern. I prefer clear, maintainable code and incremental improvements — small, consistent steps that add up.

I’m calm, patient, and detail-oriented: I like debugging carefully, writing readable code, and improving projects iteratively.
